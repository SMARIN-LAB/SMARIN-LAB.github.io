<h4>Research Theme</h4>
<p><font size=4>"UNSAT" stands for the two key aspects of our research endeavor: one for physics and mechanics of UNSATurated porous media; another for UNderground Space Advanced Technologies. </font></p>
<p><font size=4> This group is directed by Prof. Chao Zhang in the Department of Civil Engineering at Hunan University. We are a part of Center for Underground Space Advanced Technologies directed by Prof. Renpeng Chen. </font></p>
<font size=4>Our current research at Hunan University encompasses the following interconnected areas:</font>
<ul >
    <li><font size=4>Phase Equilibirum and Transition in Porous Media</font></li>
    <li><font size=4>Stress State and Constitutive Relation for Unsaturated Soil</font></li>
    <li><font size=4>Soil - Shield Machine Interaction and Its Intelligent Control</font></li>
    <li><font size=4>Advanced Testing and Resilience for Underground Structures</font></li>
</ul>
