<h4>Research Theme</h4>
<p><font size=4>"SMARIN" stands for the Sustainable Materials and Resilient Infrastructure. </font></p>
<hr />

<font size=4>Our current research at University of Miami encompasses the following interconnected areas:</font>
<ul >
    <li><font size=4>Construction of eco-smart communities and sustainable built environments: e.g., multifunctional coatings and admixtures, recycling and valorization of industrial byproducts and agro-wastes, permeable pavements, and nanotechnology for civil infrastructures</font></li>
    <li><font size=4>Materials science for circular economy, for historically underserved communities, and for decarbonization, construction, and resilience of infrastructure</font></li>
    <li><font size=4>Durable and resilient infrastructure, e.g., multi-scale engineering and characterization, corrosion protection, preservation and rehabilitation techniques, self-healing concrete, coatings, and functional layers</font></li>
</ul>
